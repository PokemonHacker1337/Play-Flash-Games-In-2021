# Play-Flash-Games-In-2021

There are a surprising amount of ways to play Flash games in 2021. I will go through all the options that I am personally aware of in no particular order (except ones I haven't personally tried are on the bottom). 

1: The intended method by Adobe.
The way Adobe intends for you to play them from now on is by using their projector, which essentially acts as an emulator, as long as you have the .swf files to go with them. [Here is a mirror where you can download the official releases for Windows, Mac and Linux](https://github.com/PokemonHacker1337/HackedFlashGames/releases/tag/(InsertVersionHere))

2: [Y8 Browser](https://www.y8.com/download-app) (Available on Windows, Mac and Linux).
Y8 is intended to be a browser that's designed to be limited to only the creator's website, allowing you to play Flash Games on their website. However, you can bypass this limitation easily. Press Ctrl+Shift+i and you'll open a developer menu. Click the console button and type the following text: 
```
location.href = "http://example.com"
```
replacing example.com with any other website, like https://arcadeprehacks.com or any other website. This is one of the better solutions if you don't have any SWFs, as everything is setup for you automatically, you just have to use it to navigate to the website. 

3: [Flash Game Archive](http://www.flashgamearchive.com/download-fga-software/) (64 bit Windows only)
If you don't feel like having to do much setup, just installing and not worrying about it, this is one of the options for you. They have an archive that continuously grows, especially as people request or give games to [their Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/h5PW6NqUvA).

4: [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/) (Windows 7 and above, possible Mac and Linux support)
Same idea as FGA. It's notable for allowing you to download the entire archive in a 600+ GB file, if you want to have access to all of the games, or just downloading a lightweight version that downloads the games as you play them. 

5: [Clean Flash](https://github.com/CleanFlash/installer) (Windows XP or above, even though you should be at at least 10 by this point.)
This is where things get interesting. According to the linked page, Flash is still actively supported in China, even getting updates every single month. The idea behind this program is that it modifies the regular Flash player to be more usable. However, the problem is that it is not compatible with the latest version of browsers. I would recommend picking up a portable version of Chrome [which you can get from here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Google%20Chrome%20Portable/). I personally used 87.0.4280.88, as I believe that is the most recent version where Flash still works (however, the browser blocks it, so you'll have to change the permissions for each website, but the settings still stick). I'm not sure which versions allow using it without having to bypass it in this way without guessing every single version until I find the right one.
