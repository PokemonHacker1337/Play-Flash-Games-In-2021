# Play-Flash-Games-In-2022

There are a surprising amount of ways to play Flash games in 2022. I will go through all the options that I am personally aware of in no particular order (except ones I haven't personally tried are on the bottom). 

1: The intended method by Adobe.
The way Adobe intends for you to play them from now on is by using their projector, which essentially acts as an emulator, as long as you have the .swf files to go with them. [Here is a mirror where you can download the official releases for Windows, Mac and Linux](https://github.com/PokemonHacker1337/HackedFlashGames/releases/tag/(InsertVersionHere)). .SWF files can be downloaded from many sources, like from Flashpoint, or even simply going to Google and looking up *insert game name here* swf.

2: [Y8 Browser](https://www.y8.com/download-app) (Available on Windows, Mac and Linux).
Y8 is intended to be a browser that's designed to be limited to only the creator's website, allowing you to play Flash Games on their website. However, you can bypass this limitation easily. Press Ctrl+Shift+i and you'll open a developer menu. Click the console button and type the following text: 
```
location.href = "http://example.com"
```
replacing example.com with any other website, like https://arcadeprehacks.com or any other website. This is one of the better solutions if you don't have any SWFs, as everything is setup for you automatically, you just have to use it to navigate to the website. 

3: [Flash Game Archive](http://www.flashgamearchive.com/download-fga-software/) (64 bit Windows only)
If you don't feel like having to do much setup, just installing and not worrying about it, this is one of the options for you. They have an archive that continuously grows, especially as people request or give games to [their Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/h5PW6NqUvA).

4: [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/) (Windows 7 and above, possible Mac and Linux support)
Same idea as FGA. It's notable for allowing you to download the entire archive in a 600+ GB file, if you want to have access to all of the games, or just downloading a lightweight version that downloads the games as you play them. 

5: [Clean Flash](https://starfiles.co/file/0lvhEV9oldZE/CleanFlash34-0-0-184) (Windows XP or above, even though you should be at at least 10 by this point.):
This is where things get interesting. According to the (previously) linked page, Flash is still actively supported in China, even getting updates every single month. The idea behind this program is that it modifies that specific Flash player to be more usable. However, the problem is that it is not compatible with the latest version of browsers. I would recommend picking up a portable version of Chrome [which you can get from here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Google%20Chrome%20Portable/). I personally used 87.0.4280.88, as I believe that is the most recent version where Flash still works (however, the browser blocks it, so you'll have to change the permissions for each website, but the settings still stick). I'm not sure which versions allow using it without having to bypass it in this way without guessing every single version until I find the right one. 
Update: CleanFlash is no longer hosted on the official repo. I found a mirror on a different website, which I can confirm is the exact same program as the one on the DMCA'd repository, [you may download it here](https://starfiles.co/file/0lvhEV9oldZE/CleanFlash34-0-0-184). Since then, [they have moved to Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/cleanflash/installer), but with no download currently available as of this writing.

6: [Flashstorage.games](https://flashstorage.games):
Combined with Basilisk or any other way to run Flash through a browser (although they also do support emulation through Ruffle), it's a great way to run Flash games through your browser without even needing to install anything. 

Note: Everything below this is untested by me. I will not give support on anything below this.

7: [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/#downloads)
This appears to be an extension to allow playing Flash games on websites that don't already run Ruffle, which is designed as both an extension as well as something website developers can add to play Flash games for free. I can confirm that it works well when it is added to a website, but I cannot confirm how well the extension works as I have never used it.

8: [Supernova](https://www.getsupernova.com/extension/)
Not really sure how this works. It originally was an extension that allows playing games anyway, but I think it's now some kind of player that can be installed. I haven't found a need for this as I already have other methods of playing games, so I never felt a need to try it personally. 

9: [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/download/)
This was recommended in Clean Flash's README. I haven't tested this, but it appears to be a fork of Firefox that has Flash enabled automatically.

10: [Basilisk](https://basilisk-browser.org/download.shtml):
Possibly the same idea as Waterfox. This is probably just up to personal preference.
